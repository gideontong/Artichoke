# Artichoke

Artichoke is a small desktop app (hopefully, we can bring it to mobile soon!) that automatically aggregates prices from all the nearest grocery stores and farmers' markets using the power of the internet, croudsourcing, and the Internet of Things in order to automatically find cheap receipes. It's perfect for college students who are getting started with funds management!

## Getting Started

We don't exactly have a getting started yet because this project is still very much a work in progress. The plan is to have a server that runs 24/7 written in Python (because it is adaptable and easy to use) that automatically scans data sources for receipes and grocery prices. Then a client can access that data remotely.

Currently we are still working on the server, which is written in Python 3. You can use CPython or PyPy and simply run any of the scripts provided, since none of them are structured or in classes (yet).
